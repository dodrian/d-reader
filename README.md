# d-reader
Responsive Vue.js RSS reader with Django backend

Front end in the `dreader` directory, backend in the `djapi` directory. Live demo at [dodrian.com/dreader](https://dodrian.com/dreader)

Much work still to be done:
1) Add login/user creation functionality
2) Add new URLs to feeds
3) Add interface for creating new feeds
4) Ability to save favorite posts to 'read later' special feed
5) Clean up User Interface
