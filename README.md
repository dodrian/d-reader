# d-reader
Responsive Vue.js RSS reader with Django backend

Front end in the `dreader` directory, backend in the `djapi` directory. Live demo at [dodrian.com/dreader](https://dodrian.com/dreader)

Much work still to be done:
1) Add login/user creation functionality
2) Add new URLs to feeds
  * More sensible error handling (not silent) when URLs fail
  * Ability to delete urls
3) Add interface for creating/deleting new feeds
4) Ability to save favorite posts to 'read later' special feed
5) Clean up User Interface
